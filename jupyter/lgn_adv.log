INTERPRETATION GUIDE
================================================================================

The decoded images show the spatial pattern of LGN activity reconstructed
into image space using receptive field parameters.

What to look for:

1. **Decoded Image Quality**:
   - Do you see recognizable digit shapes?
   - Are failed samples' decoded images degraded or corrupted?
   - Are working samples' decoded images clearer?

2. **Activity Distribution**:
   - Failed samples with flat/narrow distributions → weak encoding
   - Working samples should have broader, multi-modal distributions

3. **RF Coverage** (if available):
   - Shows which parts of visual space are being sampled
   - Uniform coverage → good spatial encoding
   - Gaps or holes → potential encoding issues

4. **RF Centers**:
   - Hot spots should correspond to digit features
   - Failed samples might show random/diffuse activity patterns

If failed samples have systematically weaker or more uniform decoded images,
this suggests the LGN encoding itself is the problem (not the V1 network).
